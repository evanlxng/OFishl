  Build your own aquarium! With our interactive terminal based game, you can 
  simulate the day to day of owning an aquarium. Buy and raise different types 
  of marine animals from a goldfish to a clownfish and even a shark! Use revenue
  from your aquarium to keep your fish fed and healthy. Be careful with which 
  fish you choose to buy, some make great tank-mates but others might not. Earn 
  an achievement at the end of your game and try to beat your friends.
